    <div><p>First things first<br>
I'ma say all the words inside my head<br>
I'm fired up and tired of<br>
The way that things have been, oh-ooh<br>
The way that things have been, oh-ooh<br>

<br>Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be<br>
I'm the one at the sail<br>
I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh<br>
The master of my sea, oh-ooh<br>

<br>I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulkin' to the masses<br>
Writing my poems for the few<br>
That look at me, took to me, shook at me, feelin' me<br>
Singing from heartache from the pain<br>
Taking my message from the veins<br>
Speaking my lesson from the brain<br>
Seeing the beauty through the...<br>

Pain! You made me a, you made me a<br>
Believer, believer<br>
Pain! You break me down and build me up<br>
Believer, believer<br>
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain<br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…<br>
Pain! You made me a, you made me a<br>
Believer, believer<br>

<br>Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above<br>
All the hate that you've heard<br>
Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh<br>
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh<br>


<br>I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud<br>
Falling like ashes to the ground<br>
Hoping my feelings, they would drown<br>
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'<br>
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down<br>
It rained down, like…<br>


Pain! You made me a, you made me a<br>
Believer, believer<br>
Pain! You break me down and build me up<br>
Believer, believer<br>
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain<br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…<br>
Pain! You made me a, you made me a<br>
Believer, believer<br>


<br>Last things last
By the grace of the fire and the flames<br>
You're the face of the future<br>
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh<br>
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh<br>


<br>But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down<br>
It rained down, like…<br>


<br>Pain! You made me a, you made me a
Believer, believer<br>
Pain! You break me down and build me up<br>
Believer, believer<br>
Pain! Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain<br>
My life, my love, my drive, it came from…<br>
Pain! You made me a, you made me a<br>
Believer, believer	<br></p></div>
